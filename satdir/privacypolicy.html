Satellite Director requires access to the phone's: sensors ( GPS location and compass ), front/back camera and internal/external storage.<br>
A geostationary satellite with radio and tv channels is located at a fixed GPS position (latitude, logitude, distance from earth) in the sky. 
Because the satellite cannot be seen from earth one can find its location in the sky with some calculations that require the current GPS location and a compass reading.
The calculated direction of the satellite is displayed on the phone's screen as an arrow. 
The cameras are required to immitate a 'look through window' or 'mirror effect' which allows to align the satellite dish with displayed arrow.
Access to internal/external storage is required so a screenshot or photo can be stored but also to create your own list of satellites and store settings.<p>
 
Google requires Zekitez to disclose that Satellite Director will record camera and read sensor data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos and calculating your position with respect to a satellite position.<br>
Camera access is needed to take photos.<br>
Location access is needed to calculate the direction of the satellite.<br>
Compass access is needed to determine your position with repect to the calculated satellite position.<br>
Storage access is needed to store photos or read and write settings.<br>
